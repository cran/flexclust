Changes in flexclust version 0.9-0

  o kcca() and cclust() can now optionally return objects of class
    "kccasimple" which contains only a subset of the slots of regular
    "kcca" objects (basically only centers and cluster
    membership). Computation is faster, but no plotting methods are
    available.

  o Cluster membership vectors now preserve the rownames of the
    original data.

  o Fixed a bug in Jaccard distance computation and random break of
    ties for cluster assignment, both reported by Christian Buchta.

  o New barchart() method for visualization of centroids.

  o Utility function flxColors() can be used to access the flexclust color 
    palette. 


Changes in flexclust version 0.8-1

  o Fixed a bug in the definition of class "flexclustControl".
  

Changes in flexclust version 0.8-0

  o List ellipse as suggested package, use only when available.

  o Class "flexclust" has a new slot "clusinfo", which is modeled
    after the same slot of partition objects in package cluster. This
    replaces slots "size" and "withindist".

  o New generic info() can be used to obtain various pieces of
    information about a clustering.

  o New summary() method lists contents of clusinfo slot, show() method 
    only cluster sizes. 

  o Added details of neural gas learning paramters to 
    flexclustControl-class.Rd and fixed a type (number of parameters is 4, 
    not 3). 

  o New methods cluster() and parameters().

  o New function projAxes() to add arrows for original coordinate axes 
    to a projection plot. 

  o New pairs() method for matrix of neighborhood graphs.

  o New function dist2().

  o Improved performance of qtclust() and distCor().

  o barplot() now plots clusters by default in the same colors as
    plot().

  o Correct citation of the package is the forthcoming CSDA paper.
